##Proposed Level of Achievement: 
Project Gemini 

##Motivation: 
Traveling with friends is always exciting, but managing shared expenses can be a hassle. Keeping track of who paid for what and calculating how much each person owes often leads to confusion and miscalculations. To simplify this process, we aim to develop an app that automates expense logging, streamlines cost-sharing, and facilitates easy repayments, ensuring a stress-free and transparent financial experience during group trips.

##Aim: 
To provide an easy-to-use solution for tracking shared expenses, ensuring fair cost distribution and smooth settlements among groups.

##User Stories: 
As a traveler in a group, I want to log expenses easily, so that I can keep track of who paid for what.
As a group member, I want to categorize expenses (e.g., food, transport, accommodation), so that I can analyze spending patterns.
As a group member, I want to split expenses equally or customize the split, so that I can fairly divide the costs among participants.
As a payer, I want to assign shared expenses to specific members, so that only relevant people contribute.
As a group member, I want to view a summary of who owes how much, so that I can understand my financial obligations.
As a group member, I want to see the most efficient way to settle debts, so that I can minimize the number of transactions needed.
As a group member, I want to invite others to join an expense group, so that we can collaboratively track our spending.
As a user, I want to receive reminders for pending payments, so that I don’t forget to settle my share.

##Scope of Project: 
The website provides an intuitive platform for tracking shared expenses during group trips. It allows users to log expenses, assign payers and participants for each cost, calculate how much each person owes or is owed, and view a summary of balances.
